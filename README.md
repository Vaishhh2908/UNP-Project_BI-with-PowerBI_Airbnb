# UNP-Project_BI-with-PowerBI_Airbnb

Completed this project as part of my BI with PowerBI Internship with United Network of Professionals (UNP).

This Power BI project is built upon Airbnb data, featuring five distinct slides: Overview, Availability, Ratings, Pricing, and Summary. Utilizing measures and the query editor, the project aims to provide a comprehensive visualization of Airbnb's performance metrics. Users can explore key aspects such as property availability, user ratings, pricing trends, and an overall summary, enhancing data-driven insights for stakeholders and decision-makers.

Key Highlights:

1. Contributed in building innovative, interactive Power BI dashboards with detailed KPIs.
2. Dedicated to designing data models, conducting data transformation, and calculating using DAX for reliable analysis and reporting.
3. Dashboard is designed with a user-centric approach.
